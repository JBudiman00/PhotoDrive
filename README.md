# PhotoDrive
Google PhotoDrive abilities without requiring a google email or storing information on the google cloud. 
This project is composed of three main parts:
1. People should be able to create an account and login to their drive.
2. The drive will be a place where people can store and upload photos to a local server host cloud using a Raspberry Pi.
3. Users can create 'Albums', store iamges and give viewing priviledges to other specific users 

In addition, Albums should be able to be displayed in the frontend as a slideshow presentation (User-requested feature)
